    overview: "I designed and built a high-fidelity AI recipe creator that personalizes meals from real pantry inputs, combining LLM prompt craft, thoughtful UX, motion design, and production-ready front-end. This was a solo, end-to-end project shipped in 2 weeks, demonstrating my ability to own the entire lifecycle of an AI prototype.",
