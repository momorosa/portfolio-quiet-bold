The exisiting style guide was outdated, and the bank's rapid digital transformation led to a proliferation of over 40 different component variations of a simple component such as a button. This lack of unification in design and development resulted in a confusing user experience and inefficiencies across teams. Recognizing these challenges, I saw a critical need for a comprehensive design system that can serve consistent User Experience, minimize inter-team fricition, and build a unified digital ecosystem.",
